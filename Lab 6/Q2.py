a)	Create a Primes iterator class that will give prime numbers infinitely.
1.	Write an initializer that takes a starting number, give a default value of 2.
2.	Write the __iter__ method that returns the object itself.
3.	Write the __next__  method that produces the next prime number.
'''




'''
b)	Test the class developed in ex2 part(a) 
1.	Write a for loop to print the first 20 primes.
2.	Use list comprehension to create a list of the next 20 primes.
3.	Use islice() to create a list of the first 20 primes larger than 1 million.
